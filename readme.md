This is a simple JavaScript score keeping website and can be used to keep the track of the score during a Basketball, Volleyball or a football match and removes the hassle of manually updating the score on paper. It is written in ES5 and i have plans to update it to ES6 once i get time. It is done only for fun and as a part of my minor project. I built it just for fun to practice before i put on hands on something substantial !
